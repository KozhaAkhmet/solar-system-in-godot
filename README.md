# Solar System Simulator 

## Features
In this Solar System Simulation, you can:
  - Move planets with a mouse
  - Control velocity
  - Change mass
  - Give position
  - Visualize planet trajectory path
  - Manipulate G and distance multiplier constants
  - Capable to handle planets as much as you want (Currently planets can be added only in the editor)

## About
  Simulation's key formula is Newton's law of Universal Gravitation. This simulation not references real-life solar system, but can be used for educational purposes.

 Until June, I am planning to add features like:
  - Adding/deleting planets
  - Multi-selection
  - Save and load scenes from json

## Controls
- You can select a planet by left clicking
- Move planet by clicking then holding left click 
- Move around by holding right click
- Scroll for zoom
- You modify the selected planet by UI on top of the screen.
